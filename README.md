My first task using HTML, CSS,and Javascript. The task was to create a website To-Do list that allows the user to write a task, pick a due date,and to pick a color. From there the user can add it to their list of task. They can choose to delete a task or cross(and uncross) it out. When they cross out a task a "notification" will play.
